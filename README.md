# Toxicity Monitor

The Toxicity Monitor bot is a small Discord bot that scans all messages sent through chat and uses the Perspective API to determine the toxicity of said comments. Depending on this percentage, it appropriately acts.

**Planned Features:**

- Anti-Spam
- Chat Cooldown (configurable per-server)
- Better 'Help' Command
- Sending message to mods and offender based on warning (if possible)
- Ability to ban users based on number of infractions (configurable per-server)
- Customizable settings (per-server)
- Other model types, not just TOXICITY (will take a bit longer to roll out)

## Contributing

- Contributions are **only allowed** in the 'Testing' folder
- Any PRs that change the main code **will not be accepted**
- Any PRs that even **touch** the 'glitch' branch will not even be given a second thought (no changing the host code)
- In your PR (I don't care about your commits) try to explain what your code does and how it will benefit the bot in as much detail as possible
- No BS kthx

# Toxicity Monitor

The Toxicity Monitor bot is a small Discord bot that scans all messages sent through chat and uses the Perspective API to determine the toxicity of said comments. Depending on this percentage, it appropriately acts.

**Planned Features:**

- Anti-Spam
- Chat Cooldown (configurable per-server)
- Better 'Help' Command
- Sending message to mods and offender based on warning (if possible)
- Ability to ban users based on number of infractions (configurable per-server)
- Customizable prefix (per-server)

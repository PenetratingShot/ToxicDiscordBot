# Testing

This is the folder for the all the experimental code of the bot. It's not hosted on the main bot off the the side, rather on a separate testing bot that will require you to be whitelisted to use. DM me at 404meemr#0194 on discord or email me at slad0716@gmail.com to acquire the whitelist

## Whitelisting Rules

In the DM or email, you are to specify you discord username, email (optional), and the reason why you want to be whitelisted for this bot (whether it be testing or whatnot). Note that being whitelisted is not a right, it's a priveledge and may be revoked at any point in time. I also have no obligation to accept any requests for whitelisting.
